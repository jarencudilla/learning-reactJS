## Realization - I don't know ReactJS
# Feedback - I need to learn ReactJS
# Call to Action : 

Generate a 7 day plan to learn ReactJS
Target : Have a basic working knowledge of ReactJS to be able to code simple apps, get proficient, gain more experience to be able to handle more complex tasks/apps. 

I plan to allot at least 2 hours a day learning ReactJS on top of what I am doing at work. (If I have less tasks during work hours and the workload is light I can use that downtime to learn and practice coding).  So I dedicate minimum 2 hours after work around 10pm-12mn (realistically that's where I have free time to game and or just chill) to learn ReactJS and adapt a "learn by doing" approach.

## Day 1

- [x] Enable WSL2 on (Windows)
